# Watch Collector - Showcase Project

## Overview of project and goals

The challenge of this project was to work within strict time constraints to deliver a product that helps solve a unique problem for a niche audience. The audience I chose was watch collectors. The problem I solved was a way to search and display information about particular watches that might interest an enthusiast. In order to do this, I had to create personas and user stories to describe my target audience. An example of these would be users who want to use the app to compare prices when considering the relative affordability of various watches. Another example would be users who want to search for watches that have certain features or complications like a day-date, a chronograph, or a particular type of dial. The app I created allows users to see a display of watches with their specifications. Users can also search a dataset for watches by name, type, and price. The search results are displayed in a separate view. The dataset is part of an API that I built with Express and used for this project. This backend works with the frontend application I built using React, Router, Cypress, PropTypes, Asynchronous JavaScript and Responsive Design.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`
